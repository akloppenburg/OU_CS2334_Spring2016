 * Note that the field <code>newsMakers</code> and all methods in this class are
 * static because we don't need to make several <code>NoozFileProcessor</code>
 * objects and have them maintain their own lists of news makers. Instead, we
 * simply need a collection of useful methods to create a list and return it to
 * the calling method that will keep track of it.
